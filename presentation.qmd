# Introduction

## Car Evaluation Data Target

Created by the efforts of M. Bohanec in the late 1980s

### Acceptability

1. `unacc`: Unacceptable. Cars that fail to meet basic criteria.
2. `acc`: Acceptable. Cars that meet minimum requirements.
3. `good`: Good. Cars that exceed average standards in some aspects.
4. `vgood`: Very good. Cars that meet the highest standards.

## Car Evaluation Data Features

Created by the efforts of M. Bohanec in the late 1980s

| Feature Name | Data Type | Values |
| ------------ | --------- | ------ |
| `buying` | Categorical | `low`, `med`, `high`, `vhigh` |
| `maint` | Categorical | `low`, `med`, `high`, `vhigh` |
| `doors` | Categorical | `2`, `3`, `4`, `5more` |
| `persons` | Categorical | `2`, `4`, `more` |
| `lug_boot` | Categorical | `small`, `med`, `big` |
| `safety` | Categorical | `low`, `med`, `high` |

# Exploratory data analysis

## Target Class Distribution

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}
- The dataset is imbalanced, with a majority of cars labeled as `unacceptable`.
- **Implications**:
  - Models might overpredict the `unacceptable` class.
  - Metrics like accuracy could be misleading, requiring metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Feature-Target Relationships

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
- Record counts visualized by target and category.
- **Observation**:
  - Majority class: `unacceptable`.
  - Minority classes: `acceptable`, `good`, `vgood`.

# Selecting our model

```{python}
# imports
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import Markdown, display
from tabulate import tabulate

model_selection_results = pd.read_csv("results/tables/model_selection_results.csv").round(3)
```

## Shortlisting models from `sklearn`

| Type | Model |
| ---- | ----- |
| Baseline | `DummyClassifier` |
| Classification |  `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `KNearestNeighbors` |
| Hyperplanes | `SVC` |
| Probabilistic | `MultinomialNB` |
| Regression | `LogisticRegression` |

## Model selection with cross-validation {.smaller}

```{python}
Markdown(model_selection_results.to_markdown(index=False))
```

## The chosen model: `SVC`

Finding hyperplane that best separates the different classes (`quality`)

* "Curved" hyperplanes great for overlapping features

* Shorter `predict` times (versus `KNearestNeighbors`)

* Less susceptible to overfitting (versus `DecisionTreeClassifier`)

# Model tuning

## SVC RBF model has 2 hyperparameters:

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **`C`**: Controls the trade-off between complexity and accuracy.
- **`gamma`**: How far the influence of a single training example reaches.

## Our random search result: 
![Heatmap of test scores obtained during hyperparameter optimisation](./results/figures/car_hyperparameter.png){width=60%}
```{python}
import pickle
test_scores_df = pd.read_csv("./results/tables/test_scores.csv").round(2)
classification_report = pd.read_csv("./results/tables/classification_report.csv").round(3)
with open('./results/models/car_analysis.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    car_eva = pickle.load(f)
model_selection_results = pd.read_csv("./results/tables/model_selection_results.csv").round(3)

print()
```

`C` and `gamma` are `{python} car_eva.best_params_['svc__C']` and `{python} car_eva.best_params_['svc__gamma']`

## Fit the model and result

```{python}
#| tbl-cap: Classification report of the model

Markdown(classification_report.to_markdown(index=False))
```

## Conclusion

- **Best Model**: SVM RBF achieved a test accuracy of **95.2%** and an **F1 score of 0.99**, showing strong performance even with class imbalance.
- **Key Insight**: Slight recall issue for class “good” (0.857) suggests room for improvement.
- **Future Work**: Incorporate numeric features (e.g., fuel efficiency) and additional data to enhance predictions.
- **Impact**: The model provides a practical tool to support informed car purchasing decisions.
