# Team Contract

Team members:
Danish Karlin Isa,
Nicholas Varabioff,
Ximin Xu,
Zuer Zhong

## Expectations

All works will be distributed fairly and equally to the best of our abilities,
depending on the week’s assignment.
Each person is expected to work on the project for a maximum of 6 hours per week.

Should any member feel that the work allocated to them is disproportionately heavy,
they will raise the issue up as soon as possible so that a solution can be discussed and agreed upon by all members.

All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. 
This includes making sure all scripts are working,
creating tests for all functions,
compliance with accepted style guides,
compliance with academic integrity policies and using proper grammar in written submissions.

## Meetings

Meetings will be held twice a week in person:

* Mondays 2-4 pm at MCLD 3018 (during scheduled lab sessions)
* Wednesday 4-5 pm at ORCH 4074 (during office hours)

If required, meetings will also be held virtually.
The timing for this meeting shall be set on a case-by-case basis,
and each member shall actively participate in the meeting.

For Wednesday meetings, the group shall:

1. Report the progress done for each member
2. Allocate/reorganise the workload for the remaining week
3. Clarify any doubts with each other and the TA

All members are expected to attend the meetings.
If a member is unable to attend a meeting,
written notice must be given 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options.

## Communication

All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack and Github.
Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.
Github Pull Request Conversations can be used for submitting work,
reviewing work,
and adding ideas and suggestions.

All members are expected to respond to Slack messages promptly between 10 am and 9 pm (except during scheduled class hours).
Outside of these hours,
members can send/reply to messages,
however there will be no expectation for replies until 10 am the next day.

## Reviews

All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com.
Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have pull requests reviewed by teammates.
Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.

## Roles

Each week we will assign 1 person for each of the following roles:

* Proof-reader:
Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.
* Scribe:
Responsible for taking notes at meetings and sharing notes and weekly work allocation in Slack.

With 4 team members and 4 weeks, each team member is expected to do each role once.

## Deadlines

All work allocated during Monday’s lab session should be completed and ready for review during Wednesday’s meeting.

Each member shall complete all their assigned work for the week and have it ready for submission by Friday at 7 pm.

The proof-reader shall compile all completed work in accordance with the assignment’s submission requirements,
and submit it to Gradescope before the deadline (as specified by the MDS calendar).

## Breach of Contract

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:

1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and for the member to write an agreement to follow the team contract.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs regarding the issues with the member.
